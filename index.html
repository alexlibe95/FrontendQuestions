                <span>Explain what is lazy loading?</span>
                <p>Lazy loading is a design pattern generally utilized in computer programming to delay initialization of an object until the period at which it is required. It can contribute to performance in the program’s operation if correctly and properly utilized. Besides, it is a loading code only once the user needs it. For instance, there is a button on the page, which reveals a different layout once the user pressed it. Hence, there is no necessary to load code for that layout on initial page load.</p>

                <p>Inheritance in JavaScript is different from most other programming languages. The object system in JavaScript is prototype based, not class based. Objects in JavaScript are just a collection of a name (key) and value pairs. When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Every object has a private property which contains a link to another object called its prototype.</p>

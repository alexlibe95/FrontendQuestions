                <span>Explain the importance of the HTML DOCTYPE?</span>
                <p>DOCTYPE is an instruction to the web browser regarding what version of the markup language the page is written. The DOCTYPE declaration need to be the pretty first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. Doctype declaration points to a Document Type Definition (DTD). It provides markup language rules, so a browser can interpret the content correctly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain what is lazy loading?</span>
                <p>Lazy loading is a design pattern generally utilized in computer programming to delay initialization of an object until the period at which it is required. It can contribute to performance in the program’s operation if correctly and properly utilized. Besides, it is a loading code only once the user needs it. For instance, there is a button on the page, which reveals a different layout once the user pressed it. Hence, there is no necessary to load code for that layout on initial page load.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain what is the difference between Class and Prototypal inheritance?</span>
                <p>Inheritance in JavaScript is different from most other programming languages. The object system in JavaScript is prototype based, not class based. Objects in JavaScript are just a collection of a name (key) and value pairs. When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Every object has a private property which contains a link to another object called its prototype.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Can you explain the difference between visibility: hidden; and display: none?</span>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Visibility: hidden; – It is not visible but gets up it’s original space.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Display: none; – It is hidden and takes no space.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Describe what is the difference between Null and Undefined?</span>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Null is an object with no value.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Undefined is a type.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain the difference between classes and IDs?</span>
                <p>Classes and ID selectors, both are utilized as hooks for CSS styles. The ID’s are commonly used to style elements that only look once on a page, such as one instance of a navigational menu. The Classes are utilized to style different elements in the same fashion, such as the presence of links.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>How can you increase page performance?</span>
                <p>I can increase the page performance by the following methods:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Clean up the HTML document.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Reduce external HTTP requests.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Sprites, compressed images, smaller images.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Incorporate JavaScript at the bottom of the page.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Minify CSS, JavaScript, HTML.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>CDN and Caching.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?</span>
                <p>this is a little tricky in JavaScript. Its value is determined by what the function you are inside of is called. In the global state, this is set to the window object. The value of this also depends on whether or not you are in strict mode. Inside a top-level function, a strict mode this will be undefined, whereas a non-strict mode this will be the window object. It's also worth knowing that the value of this can be overwritten with the bind method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is Ajax?</span>
                <p>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows applications to transport data to/from a server asynchronously without refreshing the page. This means that it is likely to update parts of a web page, without reloading the entire page. For instance, your new Gmail messages arrive and are marked as new even if you have not refreshed the web page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between let, const, and var?</span>
                <p>Originally, var was the only option JavaScript had for defining variables. In ES6, we got const and let as additional options. The important takeaways are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Variables defined with const cannot be reassigned.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Const and let variables are block-scoped.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Var variables are function scoped.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Variables defined with var are hoisted.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between == and ===?</span>
                <p>Doubles equals checks for value only. Before checking, it does any necessary type coercion. For example, the string "1" will be == to the integer 1, but it will not be ===. Many projects these days prefer to always use ===. Although, some folks advocate writing code that works well with the == type coercion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is functional programming in JavaScript?</span>
                <p>Functional programming refers to using pure functions. In the context of JavaScript, this means familiarizing yourself with map, filter, and reduce. It's also worth understanding the concept of immutability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What are some alternatives to writing pure CSS?</span>
                <p>Lots of teams use a CSS preprocessor like Less or SASS. Some teams use css-in-js libraries like styled-components. Others still use utility frameworks such as Tailwind. Again, no need to learn how to use all of these, but they are nice to be aware of at a high level!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What are some options for testing JavaScript code?</span>
                <p>Unit test frameworks like Jest are very popular. Teams also use tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to test the entire website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between unit tests and end-to-end tests?</span>
                <p>There is a ton of overlap but at a high-level unit tests mean testing your actual code. Making sure that functions return expected results when given specific inputs. End-to-end tests are intended to test the website itself, not the code. They simulate clicks and scrolls and make sure the site behaves accordingly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the box model?</span>
                <p>The CSS box model refers to the way CSS handles layout. Each element is composed of its content, padding, border, and margin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between inline and block elements?</span>
                <p>Inline elements cannot have a height or width. Examples of inline elements include span, a, and img. Block elements get their own line and take up the full width available. Examples of block elements are div, p, and h1.</p>
            </li>       
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between Block, Inline,  Inline-block, and Box-sizing?</span>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Inline is the default. For example: An inline element is &lt;span&gt;.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Block shows as a block element, such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt;.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Inline-block shows an element as an inline-level block container.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Box-sizing displays the browser sizing properties.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain what is Event Delegation?</span>
                <p>Event delegation points to the process of using event propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It enables you to avoid adding event listeners to particular nodes; instead, you can add a single event listener to a parent element.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Describe when would you use the CSS float property?</span>
                <p>Float is used when you need to want an element of your web page to be pushed to the right or left and make other elements display around it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?</span>
                <p>Cookies allow applications to store data in a client’s browser. Session storage property allows applications to store data until the browser window is closed. Local storage property allows applications to store data without an expiration date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is a bundler?</span>
                <p>We like to author code by separating components into individual files. This makes it nice for us as developers but would be very slow if you try to force the user to load all 100+ files. Therefore we use a tool like webpack to grab all the files and concatenate them together. That way, we can serve 1 or 2 "bundles" of code instead of 100 individual files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is a CDN?</span>
                <p>A Content Delivery Network like Cloudflare gives us geographically distributed servers so people can load our app from a location near them. Instead of people all over the world having to wait for files to come from your hometown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain meta tags in HTML</span>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Meta tags always go inside head tag of the HTML page.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Meta tags is always passed as name/value pairs.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Meta tags are not displayed on the page but intended for the browser.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Meta tags can contain information about character encoding, description, title of the document etc.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is Scope in JavaScript?</span>
                <p>In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that function can access that function's scoped variables.<br />A variable name has to be unique within the same scope. A scope can be nested inside another scope. If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is npm?</span>
                <p>Npm stands for Node Package Manager. npm provides following two main functionalities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Online repositories for node.js packages/modules which are searchable on search.nodejs.org.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Command line utility to install packages, do version management and dependency management of Node.js packages.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is webpack?</span>
                <p>Webpack is a build tool that puts all of your assets, including Javascript, images, fonts, and CSS, in a dependency graph. Webpack lets you use require() in your source code to point to local files, like images, and decide how they're processed in your final Javascript bundle, like replacing the path with a URL pointing to a CDN.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Why and when should I Use Webpack?</span>
                <p>If you're building a complex Front End application with many non-code static assets such as CSS, images, fonts, etc, then yes, Webpack will give you great benefits.<br />If your application is fairly small, and you don't have many static assets and you only need to build one Javascript file to serve to the client, then Webpack might be more overhead than you need.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Explain the CSS “box model” and the layout components that it consists of</span>
                <p>The CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Padding - A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content).</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Border - A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Margin - A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements).</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>How JavaScript and jQuery are different?</span>
                <p>JavaScript is a language While jQuery is a library built in the JavaScript language that helps to use the JavaScript language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What are advantages of REST web services?</span>
                <p>Some of the advantages of REST web services are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Learning curve is easy since it works on HTTP protocol.</span>
                        </li>

                <span>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</span>
                <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.<br />The page provided by the server when someone requests it is unaltered. Instead, an XSS attack exploits a weakness in a page that include a variable submitted in a request to show up in raw form in the response. The page is only reflecting back what was submitted in that request.</p>

                <span>What is Sass?</span>
                <p>Sass or Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets is a CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.<br />A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS.</p>

                <span>What is a CSS rule?</span>
                <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the use of clear in CSS?</span>
                <p>It is a CSS property which is used to clear of an floating elements are not allowed to float. Its default value is "none". We can also use "clear:left" or "clear:right"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is strict mode?</span>
                <p>Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is encapsulation?</span>
                <p>Encapsulation is defined as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is polymorphism?</span>
                <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as one interface, multiple functions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>What is the difference between span and div?</span>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>Div is a block element.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Span is inline element</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>For bonus points, you could point out that it’s illegal to place a block element inside an inline element, and that while div can have a p tag, and a p tag can have a span, it is not possible for span to have a div or p tag inside.</p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>PUT puts a file or resource at a particular URI and exactly at that URI. If there is already a file or resource at that URI, PUT changes that file or resource. If there is no resource or file there, PUT makes one.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>POST sends data to a particular URI and expects the resource at that URI to deal with the request. The web server at this point can decide what to do with the data in the context of specified resource.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>PUT is idempotent meaning, invoking it any number of times will not have an impact on resources.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>However, POST is not idempotent, meaning if you invoke POST multiple times it keeps creating more resources.</span>
                        </li>

                <span>What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?</span>
                <p>CORS is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and it allows you to make requests from one website to another website. But for security reasons, a browser is not allowed to load requests to other domains when those requests are generated by scripts. CORS addresses this issue by supplying a header that will define which domains can make XMLHttpRequests.</p>

                        <li>
                            <span>Adaptive Web Design : It not necessarily set on a fluid grid; targets specific device resolutions like (320, 768, 1024 etc); can have set relative widths with (%) and controlled by media query.</span>

                <span>What is a CDN and what is the benefit of using one?</span>
                <p>CDN is a Content Delivery Network and is a series of servers that are distributed all over the world and all are linked together. <br />Benefits Of Using CDN:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>CDN files are placed on different domains. Apart from that, a single Content Delivery Network allows the browser to download four files at a single time.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
